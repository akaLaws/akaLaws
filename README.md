### "Woop Woop"

- 💾 **What you'll find:** Honsestly mostly just assignments and materials that I developed for my students when teaching webdevelopment @ Roskilde technical College. I haven't had the time or energy to make anything much impressive of my own yet.
- 🌱 **What I'm currently learning:** While looking for a job I'm not one to sit by idly so I've been playing around with `Qwik` and `TS` setting up my own site and whatever pseudo project came to mind.
- 💞 **What I want to learn:** I've been sending a lot of flirty eyes to `Rust` the past year and I'm definetly going to pick it up when the context presents itself. It seems like the perfect bridge between my love for hardware, UX and anything in between.
- 🧐 **What do I even know:** I've spend a year teaching frontend webdevelopment to adults, mainly `react`, `JS`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `tailwind` and `HTML`. I know something about business development and entrepaneurship. I studied electrical Engineering and Danish technical university working with `VHDL`, `C`, `matlab` and `python`. I was insanely fascinated by the transformation of electrical currents to binary data to a UI manipulating the data and all the way back again for an altered output. I initially got introduced to coding with `JS`, `PHP`, `MySQL`, `C#`, `SQL`, 
- 👷 **What do I want to work with:** I desperately just want to code not just in a theoretical or academic context - frontend being most fresh in my mind but I'm more than willing to work with new languages or even old ones.
- 😲 **What impresses me:** My 4 year old kid absolutely owning in coding games while draped over the back of the armchair while looking at the tablet lying on the seat of the chair, upside down from his viewpoint. Now **that's** a level of elite coding mastery I can only ever dream of.
